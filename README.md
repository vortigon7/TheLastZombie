# TheLastZombie

A small project for a one-week game jam we're doing for our own entertainment.
Might develop the game further after the jam has ended (because we like it so much).

Welcome to the Apocalypse!

You're the last living man, everyone else is a zombie. But oops, you're also infected with the virus. With the help of cybernetic components, you're able to keep the virus at bay, but you're running out of time and antidote, so you decide to murder as many zombies as you can before the lights are out, and hopefully find something out about how the whole thing happened.
